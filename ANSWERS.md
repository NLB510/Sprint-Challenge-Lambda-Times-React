1. Proptypes is a package that can be installed into a React project. It allows a developer to validate data during development as its passed down to child compponents from its parent as props at the time a component is created.

2. One of lifecycle method is `componentDidMount()` which is a method that gets invoked after `render()`. It's common use is for the asynchronous loading of data or anything else that may need to happen after a component is loaded. It's only called once during the entire React lifecycle. 

3. Higher Order Component is a pattern in React in which a functional component receives another component as its argument. Components build via a higher order component will potentially share logic or can even be conditionally rendered based on it's state.

4. The first way we can style components is via basic css. The benefit would be flexability. A developer could break css off into separate files or hold all styles in one file. The second method is reactstrap, which is a framework with a wide array of prebuilt styled components that can be used in React. The benifit with reactstrap would be the ease ability to quickly and easily style a project, since the styling is pretty much done for you. The last method would by the use of styled-components. Styled-components is a library that allows css to be written in JS. The benefit of styled-components is that all code would live in the same .js file, which could perhaps make refactoring and organization easier.
